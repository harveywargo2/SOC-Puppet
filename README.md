Python Libraries for Threat Detection Engineering

I am not a Developer but a Detection Engineer who likes to apply python to my daily Hunting and Detection Development.
Very tired of the limitations in moderns SIEM tools and other blue team platforms.


## Notable Libraries

### detectpy
- Detection Logic Library 
- Logic stored in yaml format for readability
- Can be called via python functions for hunting in a Jupyter NoteBooks or scripts
